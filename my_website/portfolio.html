    <p>Reflection <br> Purpose: The purpose of this game is for the wizard to collect the fruit.</br> Through this game, I developed a greater understanding of how to manipulate costumes and effectively use scripts to create unique character movements, utilized in the creation of my own game. I learned how to switch costumes of certain sprites when they touched other sprites, crucial in the objective of this game as well as my own game. I also established a deeper understanding of how to set the position of a sprite to certain coordinates or to set it to a random position. These were essential in the creation of my game.</p>

    <p>Reflection</p>
    <p>Purpose: The purpose of this game is to collect as many points as possible. For this game, I focused particularly on the movements of my sprites to ensure it ran smoothly. Two crucial elements of my game were the independent movement of the ghosts as well as the movement of the Pac Man sprite itself. Each ghost sprite had to move independently of one another and Pac-Man and to navigate through the maze, something I could not just randomly set the position of the sprite to. I instead selected certain coordinates for the sprite to glide to in a set duration of time. To increase efficiency and decrease my work load, I set each ghost sprite to have the same movements though at different starting points corresponding to the player's current score. I also had to establish the Pac-Man's movement so that it resembled the original game in which the Pac-Man character opened and closed his mouth repeatedly and moved continuously through the maze. To incorporate these aspects, I created costumes of the sprite to switch between an open mouthed and close mouthed character. For the continous movement, I simply set the Pac-Man movement to forever.</p>
    <p>I encountered several difficulties through the development of both games. With the first game, I had limited knowledge of how to use Scratch as well as all of its functions and scripts. In the second game, my still-limited knowledge required me to spend extensive time on each aspect and limited what I was able to complete and what my sprites were able to do. One specific example was Pac-Man's movement through the walls of the maze. My original intention was for Pac Man to navigate the maze by itself by setting its movement only when it was touching black rather than the blue maze walls. However, this did not work, allowing Pac-Man to move through the walls of the maze. I simply chose to incorporate this aspect into the game as I was unable to figure out how to change it until I develop a more advanced understanding of Scratch.</p>

	  <p>Reflection: Interactive Fiction - Python</p>
	  <p>My interactive fiction story follows the adventure of a young hero by the name of Alexander as he embarks on a quest to defeat a dark mage. He encounters several difficulties before he can complete his mission, including battling a troll, a test of intellect, and testing his instincts.</p>
	  <p>Prior to programming the story, my partner and I produced an outline to our story, laying out our various pathways for our character. Once completed, we proceded to program the story, which required several crucial programming concepts in Python as the basis of the game demonstrated the extensive usage of if-else statements and functions. The game also required me to understand the function raw-input, which prompts players to make a decision. This creates various pathways and outcomes to the player's actions. Another significant aspect in the completition of the game was the use of a function within another function, requiring me to be aware of my various functions and pathways to ensure they ran smoothly. While working on my game, there were minimal issues with programming, concerning certain functions and small errors in syntax. Overall, I enjoyed working on this interactive fiction story as though tedious in creating the various pathways, it was thought-invoking. I particularly liked the decision poionts within the story as all outcomes, except for one pathway, led to the death of our hero, making the game more complex. If I had the chance to do this over again, I would try out more pathways and decision points.</p>
