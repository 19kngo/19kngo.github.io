As she reached early adulthood, Lovelace was introduced to aspring computer scientist and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and "father of the computer", Charles Babbage. Babbage fostered Lovelace's interest in computer science and programming by showing her his Difference Engine. During this time, Lovelace also expressed her interest in advanced mathematics and studied differential calculus under the guidance of Professor Augustus De Morgan of the University of London. Lovelace also conversed with renown Scottish astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville, who Lovelace discussed mathematics and Babbage's Differential Engine with.</p>
