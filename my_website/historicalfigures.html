      <p><br>Born: December 10, 1815</br></Born:><br>Died: November 27 1852</br><br>Education: Studied at University of London</br></p>
      <p> As Lovelace was from an affluent family, Lovelace was tutored thrughout her childhood and adolescence, showing much interest in mathematics and science. As she reached early adulthood, Lovelace was introduced to aspring computer scientist and Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, Charles Babbage. Babbage fostered Lovelace's interest in computer science and programming by showing her his Difference Engine. During this time, Lovelace also expressed her interest in advanced mathematics and studied differential calculus under the guidance of Professor Augustus De Morgan of the University of London. Lovelace also conversed with renown Scottish astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville, who Lovelace discussed mathematics and Babbage's Differential Engine with.

      <p>Accomplishments <br>Regarded as the world's first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace contributed much to the development of the computer and the establishment of the field of computer science and programming. Her publication of notes commenting on Babbage's Analytical Engine gained popularity and demonstrated her extensive knowledge of calculus and the workings of his invention. Her added notes comprised two-thirds of the complete work that she translated. Her notes explained Babbage’s work and described how the analytical engine would sequentially compute Bernoulli numbers, which, at the time, were computed by hand. Her suggestions within his notes created what most consider the first algorithm as the process to compute Bernoulli numbers required a loop.</br></p>

       <p>Image of Babbage's Analytical Engine The machine demonstrates the first prototypes of the modern-computer developed. This is significant as it indicates the developing field of computer science and the growing interest in developing such machines. Babbage's Analytical Engine exposed Lovelace to the idea of computing and helped to foster her interest in computer science.</p>
      <p>Lovelace's understanding of how numbers could be used to represent more than just quantities and a machine could be made that could manipulate all types of data foreshadowed the development of the modern computer. Writing that the analytical engine “might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations… Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of [mathematical] expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent," Lovelace was the first to understand and express the potential of converting any data into numbers that could be manipulated by algorithms, Lovelace laid the foundation for the development of the early computer.</p>
